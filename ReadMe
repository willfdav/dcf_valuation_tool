## How to Use the Tool

Valuation is not an exact science; it is a game of probability. The output of this tool is a **prediction**, not a fact. The accuracy of the "Calculated Stock Price" depends entirely on the quality of your assumptions.

Use the sliders in the sidebar to test different scenarios. Here is a guide on how to set your predictors:

### 1. Revenue Growth Rate (Years 1-5)
This slider estimates how fast the company will grow its sales over the next five years.
* **How to estimate:** Look at the company's historical growth (provided in the app) and consider the industry average.
* **Rule of Thumb:** Mature companies often grow at GDP rates (2-3%), while younger, high-growth tech companies might sustain 15-20% growth.
* *Tip:* Be conservative. It is better to be pleasantly surprised than disappointed.

### 2. Terminal Growth Rate (Year 5+)
This represents the steady rate the company will grow at **forever** after the initial 5-year period.
* **Constraint:** This number must be lower than the WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) for the math to work.
* **Guidance:**
    * **Mature / Utility Companies:** Stick to 2.0% - 2.5% (roughly the rate of inflation/GDP).
    * **Newer / High-Potential Companies:** You can justify a slightly higher rate (e.g., 3.0% - 3.5%), but be careful—assuming high growth forever is risky.

### 3. FCF Margin (Free Cash Flow Margin)
This measures how much cash the company generates for every dollar of revenue.
* **Default:** The tool defaults to the company's "Trailing Twelve Month" (TTM) margin.
* **When to Override:** If a company had a bad year (one-time expenses) or is a young startup expecting to become more profitable as it scales, use the **Manual Override** slider to input a margin closer to the industry standard.
